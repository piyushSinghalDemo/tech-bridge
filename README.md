## Code Guidelines

- In your editor settings, set convert tabs to spaces, tab size to 2. (all editors have this feature, Do a google search, ask a colleague, but make this change).

- Write descriptive commit messages.

- Don't commit too many files in a single commit, break commits to logical blocks.

- If you feel the commit is not stable add a "WIP: " prefix in the commit message.

- Any code you write should be preceded by a comment explaining what is the intent of the code. At the very least each method should have a comment explaining what it does.

- Create feature branches from development branch. eg. to add a new type module create a branch feature_new_module.

- Once a feature is done open a pull request to merge changes to staging.

- At all times the master should be stable, all tests/trials should happen on staging/development branches
